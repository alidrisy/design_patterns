# Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software developers encounter during application design and development. They serve as templates that can be adapted to solve specific design challenges, offering a standardized way to build software that is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

In backend development, design patterns provide a framework for structuring your code, ensuring that it is both modular and robust. They are not about reinventing the wheel but about applying established practices that have been proven to work in numerous scenarios.

That’s all there’s about Design Patterns. They are not frameworks, languages, or tools. They are simply patterns or ways you could write or structure your code based on what has been proven to work over time.

## Prerequisites

As we progress in this Design Pattern series, you must know Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) very well because design patterns tend to favor OOP. Though the patterns are adapted to any style of coding, I will be using OOP concepts. The code snippets provided may be in Node.js or Java depending on which I'm comfortable with. However, I will try to make it language-agnostic to help you adapt it to your programming language.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns can be broadly classified into three categories:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**

Creational patterns deal with the process of object creation. They abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. These patterns help ensure that your code can create objects in a flexible and scalable way.

### 2. **Structural Patterns**

Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects. They help ensure that different components of a system work together in a cohesive way while keeping them independent. These patterns simplify the design by organizing classes and objects in a way that makes them easier to maintain and extend.

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**

Behavioral patterns define the communication between objects, focusing on the flow of control between them. These patterns are used to deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Next Steps

In the upcoming sections, I will explain each category in detail, along with examples. We will start with the **Creational Patterns** and proceed to **Structural** and **Behavioral** patterns.

### Upcoming Topics:

- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Flyweight, Facade, Bridge, Decorator
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Mediator, Iterator, Visitor, Template Method, Interpreter, Memento

Feel free to check the upcoming examples for each pattern and how they can be implemented in different languages.
